## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern:** Ensures a clean separation of UI, business logic, and data handling, making the app maintainable and testable.

### Modern Android Development Tools
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow:** For asynchronous operations and reactive programming.
- **StateFlow:** Lifecycle-aware state management, ensuring data persistence across app lifecycle events.
- **Room Database:** Used for offline storage of weather data, allowing the app to function without an active internet connection.
- **WorkManager & AlarmManager:** Handles background tasks like fetching weather updates and scheduling weather alerts.
- **ViewModel:** Ensures data is retained across configuration changes, such as screen rotations.

### Networking
- **Retrofit:** Used for making API calls to fetch weather data.

### Location Services
- **Google Location Services:** Automatically detects the userâ€™s current location to provide relevant weather updates.
- **Geocoder:** Converts latitude/longitude into human-readable addresses.

### Notifications
- **Android Notification Channels:** Ensures proper handling of weather alerts, including silent and priority notifications.

### Additional Libraries
